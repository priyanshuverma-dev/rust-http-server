## ✨ Features  

1. It supports api requests and html files,
2. We can create a api route for the following methods:
  * GET
  * POST
  * PUT
  * DELETE

  *We can add more but as of now I don't have time to add them, If you want then feel free to add and work around.*

3. The Project is completely memory safe as the language Rust is and very performance effective as it doesn't and a clone of any request and saves every bit of memory.
